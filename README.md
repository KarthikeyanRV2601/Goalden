One of the biggest problems that people of the 21st century face is procrastination. Most of us never realize our true potential because we never put in the necessary work.
The pandemic has worsened this situation as we have no one to monitor or guide us during our day-to-day activities. Our goals and dreams get farther and farther away from us each day.
Our app Goalden, aims to solve this daunting problem by creating a social atmosphere to keep you accountable and motivated throughout your journey to achieve your goals.
