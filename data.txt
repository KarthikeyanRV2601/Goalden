Read 1 book every month

Reading has been something that I've always wanted to do. Unfortunately, my hectic schedule has made me not read a 
single book in 2020!  However, with you guys' motivation I plan to start reading one book every month. 
Wish me luck!!

    My colleague suggested this book to me. Read the first few pages. Very interesting!

    1984 is sooo good. I'm hooked. 

    Our world and the world in 1984 are not that different. This book is very thought provoking
